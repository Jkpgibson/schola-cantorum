# Chants for the Latin Mass

This project is meant to aid technologically adept schola members, ministers, and lay faithful in the preparation of songbooks and worship aids for the Catholic Latin Mass. Included in this repository are:

* Ordinaries (I-XVIII),
* Propers (Introit, Gradual, Alleluia, Offertory, Communion, etc.), and
* Various Hymns and Antiphons.

Each chant is encoded in [gabc][gregorio] notation from the _Gregorian Missal_, _Liber Cantualis_, and other sources.

# Work In Progress

This project is far from complete, and contributions are more than welcome.

# Resources

* [The Gregorio Project][gregorio] - Gregorian chant notation and typesetting tools
* [Illuminare Score Editor](http://dev.illuminarepublications.com/gregorio/) - web app for writing and editing gabc
* [Corpus Christi Watershed](http://www.ccwatershed.org/) - reflections on the liturgy and many resources for the Traditional Latin Mass

# Licensing
