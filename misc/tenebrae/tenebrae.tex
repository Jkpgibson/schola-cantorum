    \Huge Tenebræ
  \end{center}

  \textbf{Tenebræ} is Latin for \emph{darkness} or \emph{shadows}. The Tenebræ
  service, which dates from the Middle Ages, recreates the emotional aspects of
  the Passion. With each read verse, a candle is extinguished. The Lord's Prayer
  is recited. It ends in darkness and with a great noise (the ``Strepitus'') that
  signifies that closing of the Tomb and the tumult in Heaven. Silence follows
  and the people leave under low light.

    Darkness fell when the Jews crucified Jesus: and about the ninth hour Jesus
    cried with a loud voice: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And he
    bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Jesus cried with a loud voice and
    said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit. And he bowed his head
    and gave up His spirit.

  1. Wash away all my guilt; from my sin cleanse me. For I know my offense; my
  sin is always before me. Against you alone have I sinned; I have done such evil
  in your sight that you are just in your sentence, blameless when you condemn.
  \Rbar.

  2. True, I was born guilty, a sinner, even as my mother conceived me. Still,
  you insist on sincerity of heart; in my inmost being teach me wisdom. Cleanse
  me with hyssop, that I may be pure; wash me, make me whiter than snow. Let me
  hear sounds of joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. \Rbar.

  1. Turn away your face from my sins; blot out all my guilt. A clean heart
  create for me, God; renew in me a steadfast spirit. Do not drive me from your
  presence, nor take from me your holy spirit. Restore my joy in your salvation;
  sustain in me a willing spirit. \Rbar.

  2. I will teach the wicked your ways, that sinners may return to you. Rescue me
  from death, God, my saving God, that my tongue may praise your healing power.
  {\Lord}, open my lips; my mouth will proclaim your praise. For you do not desire
  sacrifice; a burnt offering you would not accept. \Rbar.

  1. My sacrifice, God, is a broken spirit; God, do not spurn a broken, humbled
  heart. Make Zion prosper in your good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
  Then you will be pleased with proper sacrifice, burnt offerings and holocausts;
  then bullocks will be offered on your altar. \Rbar.

  lifeless, and without water. So I look to you in the sanctuary to see your
  power and glory. For your love is better than life; my lips offer you worship!
  \Rbar.

  2. I will bless you as long as I live; I will lift up my hands, calling on your
  name. My soul shall savor the rich banquet of praise, with joyous lips my mouth
  shall honor you! When I think of you upon my bed, through the night watches I
  will recall that you indeed are my help, and in the shadow of your wings I
  shout for joy. \Rbar.

  1. My soul clings fast to you; your right hand upholds me. But those who seek
  my life will come to ruin; they shall go down to the depths of the earth! They
  shall be handed over to the sword and become the prey of jackals! But the king
  shall rejoice in God; all who swear by the {\Lord} shall exult, for the mouths of

  goodness in the land of the living. Wait for the {\Lord}, take courage; be
  stouthearted, wait for the {\Lord}! \Rbar.

  1. Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one with whom I am pleased, upon
  whom I have put my spirit; he shall bring forth justice to the nations, Not
  crying out, not shouting, not making his voice heard in the street.

  2. A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoldering wick he shall not
  quench, until he establishes justice on the earth; the coastlands will wait for
  his teaching.

  1. Thus says God, the {\Lord}, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who
  spreads out the earth with its crops, who gives breath to its people and
  spirit to those who walk on it:

  2. I, the {\Lord}, have called you for the victory of justice, I have grasped you
  by the hand; I formed you, and set you as a covenant of the people, a light for
  the nations,

  1. To open the eyes of the blind, to bring out prisoners from confinement, and
  from the dungeon, those who live in darkness.

  \section*{Reading II: Lamentations 3}

  1. I am a man who knows affliction from the rod of his anger, one whom he has
  led and forced to walk in darkness, not in the light; against me alone he
  brings back his hand again and again all the day.

  2. He has worn away my flesh and my skin, he has broken my bones; He has beset
  me round about with poverty and weariness; He has left me to dwell in the dark
  like those long dead.

  1. He has hemmed me in with no escape and weighed me down with chains; even
  when I cry out for help, he stops my prayer; He has blocked my ways with fitted
  stones, and turned my paths aside.

  2. He has broken my teeth with gravel, pressed my face in the dust; My soul is
  deprived of peace, I have forgotten what happiness is; I tell myself my future
  is lost, all that I hoped for from the {\Lord}.

  1. But I will call this to mind, as my reason to have hope: The favors of the
  {\Lord} are not exhausted, his mercies are not spent; they are renewed each
  morning, so great is his faithfulness.

  2. My portion is the {\Lord}, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Good is
  the {\Lord} to one who waits for him, to the soul that seeks him; it is good to
  hope in silence for the saving help of the {\Lord}.

  1. It is good for a man to bear the yoke from his youth. Let him sit alone and
  in silence, when it is laid upon him. Let him put his mouth to the dust; there
  may yet be hope. Let him offer his cheek to be struck, let him be filled with
  disgrace. For the {\Lord}'s rejection does not last forever;

  \section*{Reading III: Lamentations 5}

  1. Remember, O {\Lord}, what has befallen us, look, and see our disgrace: Our
  inherited lands have been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.

  2. We have become orphans, fatherless; widowed are our mothers. The water we
  drink we must buy, for our own wood we must pay. On our necks is the yoke of
  those who drive us; we are worn out, but allowed no rest.

  1. To Egypt we submitted, and to Assyria, to fill our need of bread. Our
  fathers, who sinned, are no more; but we bear their guilt. Slaves rule over us;
  there is no one to rescue us from their hands.

  2. At the peril of our lives we bring in our sustenance, in the face of the
  desert heat; our skin is shriveled up, as though by a furnace, with the searing
  blasts of famine.

  1. The old men have abandoned the gate, the young men their music. The joy of
  our hearts has ceased, our dance has turned into mourning; the garlands have
  fallen from our heads: woe to us, for we have sinned!

  2. Over this our hearts are sick; at this our eyes grow dim: That Mount Zion
  should be desolate, with jackals roaming there! You, O {\Lord}, are enthroned
  forever; your throne stands from age to age.

  1. Why, then, should you forget us, abandon us so long a time? Lead us back to
  you, O {\Lord}, that we may be restored: give us anew such days as we had of old.

  Insult has broken my heart, and I am weak; I looked for compassion, but there

  Through your anger all my body is sick: through my sin, there is no health in
  my limbs. \Rbar.

  2. My guilt towers higher than my head; it is a weight too heavy to bear. My
  wounds are foul and festering, the result of my own folly. I am bowed and
  brought to my knees. I go mourning all the day long. \Rbar.

  1. All my frame burns with fever; all my body is sick. Spent and utterly
  crushed, I cry aloud in anguish of heart. O {\Lord}, you know all my longing: my
  groans are not hidden from you. My heart throbs, my strength is spent; the very
  light has gone from my eyes. \Rbar.

  2. For I am on the point of falling and my pain is always before me. I confess
  that I am guilty and my sin fills me with dismay. My wanton enemies are
  numberless and my lying foes are many. They repay me evil for good and attack
  me for seeking what is right. \Rbar.

  1. O {\Lord}, do not forsake me! My God, do not stay afar off! Make haste and come
  to my help, O {\Lord}, my God, my savior! \Rbar.
